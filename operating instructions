User instructions for Raduino_v1.07

After the version update the calibration value as well as the tuning pot range settings will be erased.
Use the Function Button to calibrate and set the tuning range again.

Don't have a Function Button yet?
If you don't install a pushbutton then the basic functions will still work as before
(of course you will miss the dual VFO and USB capability though).
Calibration can still be done in the old fashioned way using the CAL button.
The tuning range settings can be 'hard coded' by uncommenting lines 1062 and 1063 and adapting the values to your needs.

FUNCTION BUTTON WIRING:
Use a pushbutton to simply momentarily ground pin A3 (orange wire).
Arduino's internal pull-up resistors are used, therefore do NOT install an external pull-up resistor!

FUNCTION BUTTON USAGE:

Several functions are available with just one pushbutton.
In normal mode:
1 short press - toggle VFO A/B
2 short presses - toggle RIT on/off (not implemented yet)
3 short presses - toggle LSB/USB mode
long press (> 2 seconds) - VFO A=B

When you press the Fbutton VERY long (>5 seconds) you will enter the SETTINGS menu.
In SETTINGS mode:
1 short press - VFO frequency calibration in LSB mode
2 short presses - VFO frequency calibration in USB mode
3 short presses - set VFO drive level in LSB mode
4 short presses - set VFO drive level in USB mode
5 short presses - set lower and upper level of tuning range
long press (>2 seconds) - return to the NORMAL mode

All user settings are stored in EEPROM and read during startup.

When you keep the Fbutton pressed during power on all user settings will be erased and set back to "factory" values:
VFO calibration (LSB): 0
VFO offset (USB): 1500 Hz
VFO drive level (LSB): 4mA
VFO drive level (USB): 8mA
Tuning pot lower limit: 7100 kHz
Tuning pot upper limit: 7150 kHz
